		<p>
		The earliest foundations of what would become computer science predate 
		the invention of the modern digital computer. Machines for calculating fixed 
		numerical tasks such as the abacus have existed since antiquity, aiding in 
		computations such as multiplication and division. Further, algorithms for 
		computations have existed since antiquity, even before the development of 
		sophisticated computing equipment.

		Despite its short history as a formal academic discipline, computer science has made a number of fundamental contributions to science and society—in fact, along with electronics, it is a founding science of the current epoch of human history called the Information Age and a driver of the Information Revolution, seen as the third major leap in human technological progress after the Industrial Revolution (1750–1850 CE) and the Agricultural Revolution (8000–5000 BC).

These contributions include:

The start of the "digital revolution", which includes the current Information Age and the Internet.[21]
A formal definition of computation and computability, and proof that there are computationally unsolvable and intractable problems.[22]
The concept of a programming language, a tool for the precise expression of methodological information at various levels of abstraction.[23]
In cryptography, breaking the Enigma code was an important factor contributing to the Allied victory in World War II.[20]
Scientific computing enabled practical evaluation of processes and situations of great complexity, as well as experimentation entirely by 
software. It also enabled advanced study of the mind, and mapping of the human genome became possible with the Human Genome Project.[21] 
Distributed computing projects such as Folding@home explore protein folding.
Algorithmic trading has increased the efficiency and liquidity of financial markets by using artificial intelligence, machine learning, 
and other statistical and numerical techniques on a large scale.[24] High frequency algorithmic trading can also exacerbate volatility.[25]
Computer graphics and computer-generated imagery have become ubiquitous in modern entertainment, particularly in television, cinema, 
advertising, animation and video games. Even films that feature no explicit CGI are usually "filmed" now on digital cameras, or edited or post-processed using a digital video editor.[26][27]
Simulation of various processes, including computational fluid dynamics, physical, electrical, and electronic systems and circuits, 
as well as societies and social situations (notably war games) along with their habitats, among many others. Modern computers enable 
optimization of such designs as complete aircraft. Notable in electrical and electronic circuit design are SPICE, as well as software 
for physical realization of new (or modified) designs. The latter includes essential design software for integrated circuits.[citation needed]
Artificial intelligence is becoming increasingly important as it gets more efficient and complex. There are many applications of AI, 
some of which can be seen at home, such as robotic vacuum cleaners. It is also present in video games and on the modern battlefield 
in drones, anti-missile systems, and squad support robots.
Human-Computer Interaction combines novel algorithms with design strategies that enable rapid human performance, low error rates, 
ease in learning, and high satisfaction. Researchers use ethnographic observation and automated data collection to understand user needs, 
then conduct usability tests to refine designs. Key innovations include the direct manipulation, selectable web links, touchscreen designs, mobile applications, and virtual reality.
